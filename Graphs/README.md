Introduction:
This Java console application demonstrates the practical use of a graph data structure to solve real-world problems. It implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between locations in a network.

Features:
Create a graph by adding locations (nodes) and distances (edges).
Display the graph structure.
Calculate and display the shortest path between two specified locations.



Purpose:
The primary purpose of this application is to provide a simple yet effective solution for solving shortest-path problems in a network. Such problems are commonly encountered in logistics, transportation, and communication networks.

Contribution:
Enhancing understanding of graph data structures and algorithms like Dijkstra’s.
Serving as a learning resource for students and programmers interested in graph theory.
Providing a foundation for developing more advanced applications such as GPS systems and network optimizers.
