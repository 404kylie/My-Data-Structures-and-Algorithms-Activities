Password Manager


**Introduction:**

The PasswordManager is a Java console application designed to help users securely manage their usernames and passwords. It employs a hash table to store user credentials, ensuring that passwords are hashed and not stored in plain text. This application serves as a basic example of user authentication and password management.

**Features:**

Add User: Allows users to create a new account by entering a username and password, with passwords being hashed for security.

Authenticate User: Users can log in by providing their username and password, with the application verifying the hashed password.

Input Validation: Ensures user input is valid, providing error messages for invalid choices.

Exit Option: Users can exit the application gracefully.



**Purpose:**

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate basic principles of user authentication and data protection using hashing techniques. It serves as an educational tool for understanding how to manage user credentials securely in a simple Java application. Additionally, it helps users learn about data structures, such as hash tables, and input handling in Java.

**Contribution:**

Educational Resource: This application serves as a practical example for learners and developers interested in understanding password management and security practices. It provides insights into hashing techniques, data structures (like hash tables), and user authentication processes.


Awareness of Security Practices: By demonstrating how to securely manage passwords, the PasswordManager raises awareness about the importance of password security. It encourages users to adopt better practices for safeguarding their sensitive information.


Foundation for Future Development: The project serves as a foundation for developers to build upon. Contributors can extend its functionality, add features, or adapt it for different use cases, thereby enriching the communityâ€™s resources.
